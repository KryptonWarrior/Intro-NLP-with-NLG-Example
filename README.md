AskIrina was my first project in python. I wanted to learn python by working on a cool NLP project. Since I was impressed with NextIT virtual online assistance product “Ask Jenn”, I decided to make a simple version of that.  If you are newbie, please take a look at my presentation, [“Intro NLP”]( https://goo.gl/JFwyTJ). It gives you a general idea about NLP process.
